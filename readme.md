<h1 align="center">SHOTGUN</h1>

Shotgun is a game that is very similar to _"rock, paper, scissors"_, but allows the player to choose between _"dodge, reload, shoot"_. In this game you fight versus a robot super intelligence; See if you can beat it one on one!

When reaching max ammo you may choose _**"shotgun"**_, the ultimate attack! This attack wins you the round even if the opponent _dodges_ or _shoots_.
